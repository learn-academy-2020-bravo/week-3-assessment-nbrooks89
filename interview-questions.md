# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?w


  Your answer: Destructuring hen you create a new variable from the data of an object.

  Researched answer:
estructuring is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.


2. What are the three arguments that .map() and .filter() can accept?

  Your answer:  three arguments include value, index, and array.

  Researched answer:
  The current item.
T he current index.
 The array you called filter on.




3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: the difference is that classes hold object in them. object are what fill the classses with information.

  Researched answer: The difference is simple and conceptual. A class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer:a div is a block element and a span is an inline element. divs  are meant hold more information in them than spans

  Researched answer:he difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line whereas a div element is block-line and used to group larger chunks of code.



5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer:react fragments are the outermost carrot tags that hold all of are JSX. react fragments allow or code to run faster

  Researched answer:React.Fragment is a little bit fast and uses less memory because it doesn't need to create an extra DOM node.



6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer:i dont know the andswer im going to google it

  Researched answer:
  1.Media queries-React-Media queries let you design different layouts for different media types like screen, print, TV, handheld devices etc. Depending on the media type, you can configure the style, the font and other elements of the page.
  2. flexible layouts-Using a flexible grid to create the website layout that will dynamically resize to any width.
  3.Flexible media - Makes media (images, video and other formats) scalable, by changing the size of the media as the size of the viewport changes



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming-efers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.

- irb-The Institutional Review Board (IRB) is an administrative body established to protect the rights and welfare of human research subjects recruited to participate in research activities conducted under the auspices of the institution with which it is affiliated.
-
 Instance variable- In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable is similar to a class variable
-
Ruby hash-Hashes (sometimes known as associative arrays, maps, or dictionaries) are similar to arrays in that they are indexed collection of object references. However, while you index arrays with integers, you can index a hash with objects of any types: strings, regular expressions, and so on. When you store a value in a hash, you actually supply two objects - the index (normally called the key) and the value. You can subsequently retrieve the value by indexing the hash with the same key. The values in a hash can be objects of any type.
- Class relationships
- Getter and Setter methods in Ruby-A getter method is a method that gets a value of an instance variable.Without a getter method, you can not retrieve a value of an instance variable outside the class the instance variable is instantiated from.
A setter is a method that sets a value of an instance variable.
Without a setter method, you can not assign a value to an instance variable outside its class.
if you try to set a value of an instance variable outside its class, Ruby raises No Method Error just like it does when you try to retrieve a value of an instance variable outside its class without a getter method.
